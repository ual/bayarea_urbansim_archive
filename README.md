Simulation.py has specific data requirements, which are outlined in the Makefile of this repository, under the target `data:`.

####Downloading necessary data:

Put the following data in the data directory:

https://s3.amazonaws.com/bayarea_urbansim/data/2015_06_01_osm_bayarea4326.h5  
https://s3.amazonaws.com/bayarea_urbansim/data/2015_06_01_zoning_parcels.csv  
https://mtcdrive.box.com/2015-06-01-bayarea-v3-h5  

####Using Make to get the data:

If you are on linux/osx, and have [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) installed with the proper keys, you can fetch the necessary data by typing:
